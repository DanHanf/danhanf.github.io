<p>The snow has melted and winter has gone, and then it kind of came back, but now it seems to truly be retreating into memory. You know what that means…it’s time to rechristen the back yard with friends, booze, and the sweet perfume of Grilled Things.<br>

<pre><code>details: what does this all mean?
</code></pre>
<p>You are welcome &amp; we hope you decide to come to Dan and Jessika’s place on Saturday, April 26 any time after 11.</p>
<p><strong>Please bring something to share!</strong><br>
We will have a lot of our usual stuff, but would love for you to bring some food, booze, or anything else to share. A snack, a desert, something for the grill, alcohol, juice, tea – <em>you get the picture</em></p>
<p><a href="https://lite.framacalc.org/aa7v57fb0g-adx6">Here is a shared spreadsheet we can use</a> as an RSVP &amp; to plan so that we don’t end up with a bunch of pumpkins &amp; basil or something strange and inappropriate like that.</p>

<p>Please also feel free to bring records, games, artsy-craftsy-thingzos, any other fun stuff. a casual hang, but also: we don’t want to rage…</p>
