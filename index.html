    <p>chs-tonight is a tool that scrapes the events listings and calendars of several bars, theaters, and venue spots in Charleston, SC. The scrapers run every night, then that data is used to build a new HTML page with details and links to the events. I have a <a href="http://xoxodan.com/posts/CHS-TONIGHT%2C-PART-1%3A-HOW-DO%3F">series</a> of <a href="http://xoxodan.com/posts/CHS-TONIGHT%2C-PART-2%3A-LEVELDB-AND-HTML-GENERATION--or--HOW-TO-BORE-PEOPLE-WHO-DON'T-PROGRAM-(AND-SOME-WHO-DO)-TO-DEATH">blog</a> <a href='http://xoxodan.com/posts/CHS-TONIGHT%2C-PART-3%3A-ACHEIVE-HIP-MINIMALIST-STYLES-BY-NOT-HAVING-FUN'>posts</a> that detail the development.

    <p>Citibike hosts open ride data, which I used to make a few trip visualizations in NYC. This project was inspired by <a href='https://github.com/morganherlocker/nyc-taxi'>nyc-taxi</a> and, while now outdated, was still fun to make and pretty to look at. Here's another visualization for <a href='https://vimeo.com/146726859'>Manhattan</a> and <a href='https://vimeo.com/146947887'>Brooklyn</a>.
