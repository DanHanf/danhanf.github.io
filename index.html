    <p>chs-tonight is a tool that scrapes the events listings and calendars of several bars, theaters, and venue spots in Charleston, SC. The scrapers run every night, then that data is used to build a new HTML page with details and links to the events. The idea was that there would be a one stop shop to see what was going on in Charleston tonight, as well as an overview of upcoming events.

    <p>Citibike hosts open ride data, which I used to make a few trip visualizations in NYC. This project was inspired by <a href='https://github.com/morganherlocker/nyc-taxi'>nyc-taxi</a> and, while now outdated, was still fun to make and pretty to look at. Here are more visualizations for <a href='https://vimeo.com/146726859'>Manhattan</a> and <a href='https://vimeo.com/146947887'>Brooklyn</a>.

    <p>This is a little project I did to try out using Koa. Again, it uses open data hosted by CitiBike to show the location & usage capacity of CitiBike docks all throughout NYC.</p>
